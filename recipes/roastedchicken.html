<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Working at Jewish Summer camp, meals subsisted of bread and cheese. So, Shabbat chicken wings were the highlist of the week. Cooking was still a mystery to me, so seeing my friends dump giant containers of mustard and syrup into a pot of raw chicken took me by surprise.</p>
<p>Years later I was running a kitchen at a Jewish Summer Camp. My staff and I had a competition every Shabbat when we made chicken wings; we each made our own batch and then asked campers whose was best</p>
<p>I won most weeks just by dousing the chicken in dijon mustard and maple syrup(yes my wings cost the kitchen probably too much money)</p>
<p>It wasn't until living by myself that I actualy used this on a roasted chicken in an attemp to "be more Jewish"</p>

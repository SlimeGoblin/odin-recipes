<h2>Description</h2>

<p>I lived in Israel for 1 year after graduating college. Me and my roommate made it our mission that year to eat as much hummus as possible.</p>
<p>Every weekend we'd get up early, and hop on a bus to whatever city we'd heard might have the <a href="https://youtu.be/dP3ujl0S8uk">best of the best.</a></p>
<p>We loved arguing with anyone we could about the best spots for hummus</p>
<p>Now, Hummus is my go-to flex. It's easy. It's full of protien. It'll make the goyim feel cultured.</p>
